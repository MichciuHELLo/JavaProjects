/*										TASK
 * 									Euklide's game
 *
 * 	There are two players (A and B) in the game. 
 * 	Initially, each of them has a certain non-zero number of identical tokens.
 *	If one player has fewer tokens than the other, he may make a move. 
 *	When making a move, the player takes as many tokens from his partner as he has. 
 *	These tokens are excluded from the rest of the game (the player making the move does not take them).
 *	The game ends when neither player can make a move 
 *	(in particular, the game may end immediately after the "deal" of tokens, without making any moves). 
 *	Result: The total number of tokens for both players after the game is over.
 * 
 * 		Examples: 
 * 					1 1		=	2
 *					2 4		=	4
 *					9 6		=	6
 *
